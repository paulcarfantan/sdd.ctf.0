A Mini Capture-the-Flag on Git, SSH, and Linux

In this challenge, you must find a command that gives the response to the
exercise questions below. All exercises have been designed so that a single
command from your local machine can give the correct response. You will need to
connect to the remote server to access the files in it and can use the
interactive terminal to explore, but try to write your responses as a single
command.

You should submit your solutions by making a pull request of this repository,
adding a file "solutions/$number.md". The solution must show first the result
and the command used to obtain this result.

 If a solution has already been accepted,
you can propose a different command to get the same solution by creating a pull
request which modifies the existing solution file.

Points will be awarded for the first solution and for alternative commands
given afterwards. The points ranking will be announced on Slack by Monday, or
sooner if all exercises are completed.

Good luck!
